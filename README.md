### General Information about Project

#### * MVVM design pattern <br/> * JSON-API Call <br/> * CoreData Implementation <br/> * Custom UICollectionView <br/> * Custom UITableView

### Description 

##### * The project was built using the MVVM code architecture. <br/> * The data on the project's Home page was obtained from an API in Json format. <br/> * The user can enter one of the countries on the Home page and see the details about the country. <br/> * In addition, the user can save the desired country data from this detail page and then view it in the Saved page. <br/> * Besides, the user can delete the data from here later if he/she wishes. <br/> * One of the difficulties in the project was that the images in the given API were in "svg" format. <br/> * This issue was also taken care of with the SVGKit library. <br/> * On the other hand, since the image URL is in "http" format, adjustments were made to the info.plist.
